    "# Ultrasound Propagation in Homogeneous Media\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand functional ultrasound imaging, we first have to understand the basic physics of ultrasound. In ultrasound imaging, we use piezoelectric transducers (transducer = acts as both an emitter and a receiver) to both create ultrasound waves in a medium and measure the backscatter of that ultrasound. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although we can treat the imaging process as a black box---you don't need to understand Maxwell's equations to use a camera---, understand where the signal comes from will help us understand how to get the most out of this modality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sound in 1D\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build up our understanding of ultrasound by thinking about how compression waves propagate in water. Imagine a 1-dimensional volume of water (i.e. a tiny friction-less pipe with cross-area $A$) that's homogeneous. We suddenly push down a piston at x = 0, t = 0 by pushing a piston. Because there's an increase in density, the excess water will flow out to the left and right. Those new areas of increased density will then themselves push on the water to their left or right, creating a propagating wave of compression through the liquid. This is sound."

    "## The wave equation\n",
    "\n",
    "To figure out how the wave will propagate, we can use basic considerations about conservation of mass. We have:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\rho(x, t)$ is the density of the liquid (e.g. in kg/m). The density only varies a tiny amount above its baseline value, hence $\\rho = \\rho_0 + \\rho'(x, t)$, where the $|\\rho'| << \\rho$.\n",
    "* $u(x, t)$ is the velocity of the liquid (e.g. in m/s)\n",
    "* $p(x, t)$ is the pressure experienced by the liquid (e.g. in pascals, $N/m^2$). Again $p = p_0 + p'(x, t)$, with $|p'| << p_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By conservation of mass, no liquid is lost or created. The amount of liquid that flows through a section of the pipe is $A \\rho \\cdot u$, where A is the cross-section of the pipe. Hence the density change is given by the net outflow, $- \\frac{\\partial (\\rho u)}{\\partial x}$. Thus we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial (\\rho u)}{\\partial x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming small modulations of density from baseline, we can drop the second order terms, and obtain this equation in terms of the change in density:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\partial \\rho'}{\\partial t} + \\rho_0 \\frac{\\partial  u}{\\partial x} = 0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can look at the forces in the liquid and derive another equation from Newton's second law. The net force felt by the liquid is proportional to the spatial derivative of the pressure:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{net} = -A \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The acceleration $a$ felt by a particle is given by the total derivative:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a = \\frac{Du}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we're thinking about a static fluid, the second (convective) term is negligible. Hence, from $F = ma$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$-A \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} dx \\approx \\rho A dx \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignoring the second order terms again, we obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x} = \\rho_0 \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need an equation of state. In linear acoustics, we assume that we're near equilibrium (barotropic/adiabatic), and small perturbations in density increase the pressure linearly:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p' = \\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\rho}\\right)_s \\rho'$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant of proportionality turns out to be $(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\rho})_s = c^2$, where $c$ is the speed of sound in the medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boxed{p' \\equiv c^2\\rho'}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We take the temporal derivative of the first equation and the spatial derivative of the second equation to eliminate the cross-derivatives: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t}\\frac{\\partial \\rho'}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally using the equation of state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial x^2}}$$\n",

Here, $\\alpha_{DB} = \\alpha 20 \\log_{10} e$. Let's see what that looks like for typical fundamental frequencies for functional ultrasound. \n"

    "# What about the skull?\n",

    "So far, we've assumed that we're sending ultrasound through a homogeneous medium. However, if we needed to image through skull, or, more commonly, to focus ultrasound through skull to modulate neural activity (low-intensity focused ultrasound) or create targeted lesions (high-intensity focused ultrasound), we'd need heavier machinery to simulate wave propagation. The skull is much more rigid than the brain, and propagates sound at a much faster rate (~2800 m/s). Furthermore, the skull can propagate shear waves. The tissue-skull-brain interface creates reflections and distortions that must be accounted for to get the right wave propagation, which typically means obtaining an MRI to get the shape of the skull for a specific individual. \n",
    "\n",
    "One package that can simulate ultrasound propagation through the skull is [NTK](https://github.com/agencyenterprise/neurotechdevkit/tree/db908f66943ad4477a103dba5b8b5cb1c1690a11). They solve [this PDE through the Devito package](https://github.com/trustimaging/stride/blob/6fb1354c43667c07992f6b87fa9047e5c2066a2f/stride/physics/iso_acoustic/devito.py#L1517):\n",

    "Compared to our homogeneous equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the speed of sound $c$ changes varies through space (non-homogeneous medium)\n",
    "* the term $2 \\alpha c(x, y, z) \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial t}$ is a dissipation term similar to what we simulated in the prior section\n",
    "\n",
